Jordan Woyak demonstrated some capabilities of "hacking" the "smart port" of an older model Rokenbok command deck.
I just trying to preserve it as code.google.com will be shut down.

The video overview is on: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke8z9OBG5hA

I was able to program an Arduino to talk with the "smart port" based on information from the patents of Rokenbok Toy Company.

Among other things, the smart port enables one to manipulate the inputs of all 4 controllers and provide inputs for 4 
"virtual" controllers.
